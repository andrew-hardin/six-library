 * \class SICDWriteControl
 * \brief Specialized NITF write control that allows for writing a SICD out
 * in pieces
 *
 * Normally to write out a SICD, you'd use NITFWriteControl.  This works fine
 * when you either a) have all the pixels in memory or b) can get the pixels
 * on demand (perhaps from a file) via an io::InputStream.  If you instead have
 * a use case where you will be getting/generating pixels gradually rather
 * than all at once, and you may get/generate them in an order other than the
 * order they'll be written to disk, you can use this class instead.

     *     the data will be swapped back.
